## What is JS and Purpose of it

- The JavaScript is text-based programming language (Scripting Lang) for the Web. It can be used for both client and server-side application.
- JavaScript can update and change both HTML and CSS.
- JavaScript can calculate, manipulate and validate data.

## What are Data types in JS
JavaScript provides different data types to hold different types of values. There are two types of data types in JavaScript.

- Primitive data type
- Non-primitive (reference) data type

### Primitive data types:
- Primitive data types are a set of basic data types (predefined) from which all other data types are constructed and it has no additional methods.
- They are the building blocks of data manipulation and cannot be further divided into simpler data types.
  
ex - String , Number , Boolean , Null , Undefined


### Non-Primitive Data types:
- Non-Primitive data types are user-defined (not predefined) data types that refer to instances or objects. 
- They cannot store the `value` of a variable directly in memory. They store a `memory address` of the variable.
- Whenever a non-primitive data type is defined, it refers a memory location where the data is stored in heap memory.
- These data types are used to store multiple values.

ex - Object , Array , RegExp

### Explain Fetch
The fetch() method in JavaScript is used to request data from a server. The request can be of any type of API that returns the data in JSON or XML. The fetch() method requires one parameter, the URL to request, and returns a `promise`.

### Why we need to handle then() two times in fetch

### What is OOPs and Explain its Features

## What is Spread Operetor ?
The JavaScript spread operator ( ... ) allows us to quickly copy all or part of an existing array or object into another array or object.
## What is Rest Parameter ?
The rest parameter is an improved way to handle function parameters, allowing us to more easily handle various inputs as parameters in a function. The rest parameter syntax allows us to represent an indefinite number of arguments as an array. With the help of a rest parameter, a function can be called with any number of arguments, no matter how it was defined. Rest parameter is added in ES2015 or ES6 which improved the ability to handle parameter.

## What is Shadowing
- Variable shadowing occurs when a variable declared within a certain scope (decision block, method, or inner class) has the same name as a variable declared in an outer scope. This outer variable is said to be shadowed.

- If there is a variable in the global scope, and you'd like to create a variable with the same name in a function. The variable in the inner scope will temporarily shadow the variable in the outer scope.
