## What are Data types in JS
JavaScript provides different data types to hold different types of values. There are two types of data types in JavaScript.

- Primitive data type
- Non-primitive (reference) data type

### Primitive data types:
Primitive data types are a set of basic data types (predefined) from which all other data types are constructed and it has no additional methods.
They are the building blocks of data manipulation and cannot be further divided into simpler data types.
ex - String , Number , Boolean , Null , Undefined

### Non-Primitive Data types:
Non-Primitive data types are user-defined (not predefined) data types that refers to an instance or object. 
They cannot store the `value` of a variable directly in memory. They store a `memory address` of the variable.
Whenever a non-primitive data type is defined, it refers a memory location where the data is stored in heap memory.
 These data types are used to store multiple values.
